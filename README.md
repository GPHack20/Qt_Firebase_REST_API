# Qt_Firebase_REST_API

This provides a wrapper around the Firebase REST API for use with Qt Projects. A detailed explanation of this project can be found at [the blog post](http://piersshepperson.co.uk/programming/2017/06/26/firebase-database-rest-api-qt/). 

Details of the Firebase REST API can be found at [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/).

This porject is related to [chlasd's Firebase API](https://github.com/clkasd/qt-firebaseapi) but updated, slimmed and modernised.

To use copy the firebase.h and firebase.cpp files into your own projects. Either copy the files form GitHub indivdually, or downlaod the whole project with 

`git clone https://github.com/Sriep/Qt_Firebase_REST_API.git`
